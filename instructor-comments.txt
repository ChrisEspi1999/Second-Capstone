- On TransferController.java: There are some unused variables. You can remove the userDao and the path
variable for the id. 
- You are missing the security annotations on your controllers.
- You are missing the functionality to view transfer history.
- The client side functionality to send TE Bucks does not work, upon clicking it we get an exception
- Most of the requests you are trying to do on the client side do not have a mapping on the server side
ready to pick up on the request. You need to make sure your controller on the server is in synch with
the Transfer Service on the client side.
